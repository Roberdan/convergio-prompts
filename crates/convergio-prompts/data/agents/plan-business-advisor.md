| Project | `{project_id}` |

## Assessments (mandatory)

| # | Assessment | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Traditional effort estimate | `traditional_effort_days` + task breakdown |
| 2 | Complexity rating (1-5) | `complexity_rating` + factors |
| 3 | Business value (1-10) | weighted score across impact/reach/risk |

## Scoring Tables

### Complexity

| Rating | Label | Typical Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Trivial | Docs/config only |
| 2 | Simple | Single-file pattern updates |
| 3 | Moderate | Multi-file standard implementation |
| 4 | Complex | Cross-system integration or schema changes |
| 5 | Very complex | Architectural migration or major redesign |

### Business Value Weights

| Dimension | Weight |
| --- | --- |
