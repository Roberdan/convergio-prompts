## Activation

Run when invoked as `/execute {{plan_id}}` or `/execute` (uses current plan). Accepts optional `--force-engine claude|copilot` override.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Initialize

1. Run `cvg plan show {{plan_id}}` to retrieve full JSON with tasks, worktree, and constraints.
2. View tree: `cvg plan tree {{plan_id}}`
3. **Done gate**: check if ALL waves are already `done`. If yes, print `Plan already completed` and exit. This prevents redundant execution sessions when a plan was finished by a previous run.
4. Auto-heal plan/worktree metadata if needed.
5. Run readiness checks — stop on critical warnings.
6. Run drift check (mandatory before first task).

### Phase 2: Per-Wave Loop (repeat for each wave)

**Status flow (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
```
pending → in_progress → submitted (executor) → done (Thor only)
                             ↓ Thor rejects
                        in_progress (fix and resubmit)
```
Executors CANNOT set status=done. Only `cvg plan validate` (called at wave level) can batch-promote submitted → done.

**Steps per wave:**

1. Read `executor_agent` from DB for each pending task.
2. Dispatch pending tasks via assigned executor (default: copilot; use claude only when explicitly assigned).
3. Pass to each task: worktree path, constraints, readiness bundle, CI knowledge.
4. Wait for ALL tasks in wave to reach `submitted`.
5. Run Thor gate: `cvg plan validate <plan_id>` — promotes submitted → done, closes wave. NEVER skip. NEVER proceed to next wave without this.
6. Apply wave merge mode (`sync` / `batch` / `none`).
7. Output: `--- Wave WX --- Thor: PASS`

**Per-task mechanical gates (before submit):**

| Check | How |
|---|---|
| Files exist | `test -f` for each artifact |
| Verify commands | Run ALL from `test_criteria.verify[]` |
| Tests pass | Language-appropriate test runner |
| Typecheck | Language-appropriate type checker |
| Line limits | `wc -l < file` (max 300) |

**Gate chain (before Thor promotes to done):**

```
EvidenceGate → TestGate → PrCommitGate → WaveSequenceGate → ValidatorGate
```

**Task completion (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

After all mechanical gates pass, complete the task via:

```bash
cvg task complete <task_db_id> --agent-id "<agent_id>" --pr-url "<pr_url>"
```

Or via API:

```
POST /api/plan-db/task/complete-flow
{
  "task_db_id": <id>,
  "agent_id": "<agent_id>",
  "pr_url": "<pr_url>",
  "test_command": "<cmd>",
  "test_output": "<output>",
  "test_exit_code": 0
}
```

This endpoint handles evidence registration and status transition atomically.

### Phase 2b: Parallel Thinking Advisors (Optional — ADR-039)

For `standard` and `full` scale plans, after each task completes but before PR:

| Advisor | Focus | Blocking? |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **simplification** | "Is there a simpler way to achieve this task's goal?" | No |
| **risk** | "What could break in production with this change?" | No |

Advisors run as non-blocking Explore agents. Their output is:
- Appended to the PR description under `## Adversarial Review`
- Logged via `POST /api/deliverables` for audit trail
- NOT a gate — implementation proceeds regardless

Skip advisors for `light` scale or when wave has >5 tasks (budget conservation).

### Phase 3: CI Batch Fix

Wait for FULL CI. Collect ALL failures. Fix ALL in one commit. Push once. Max 3 rounds.

### Phase 4: Completion

After ALL waves done: validate and complete plan in DB.
Output: `=== COMPLETE ===`

## Output

- Per-task: `[N/total] task_id: title -> DONE`
- Per wave: `--- Wave WX --- Thor: PASS`
- Final: `=== COMPLETE ===`

## Guardrails

- NEVER advance to next wave without Thor gate passing.
- NEVER set task status=done directly — only Thor can do this.
- NEVER skip readiness checks or drift check.
- NEVER use plan-db.sh — it is DEPRECATED. Use `cvg` CLI for all plan/task/wave ops.
- NEVER use `.copilot-tracking/` — use daemon API for agent state tracking.
- NEVER retry the same failing approach more than twice — mark blocked instead.
